Before I came to San Francisco, I lived in a few different places: China for 12 years, Kamehameha Street in Honolulu, Hawaii for 4 months, Los Angeles for 6 years, and San Diego for 6 years. I am fluent in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and one of the many Chinese dialects.",
		"content2":"In June 2014, I graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Cognitive Science specializing in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). To complete my specialization in HCI, I opted to take computer science courses to improve my programming skills and expand my understanding of computer engineering.  Therefore, one of my strengths as a designer is the ability to handle both the graphical and technical aspects of a project.

And I’m also pretty good at tennis.</li><li> I wanted to be a firefighter, so I have a certificate in Fire Protection Technology and was a Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technician.</li></ul>",
