		"content":"My name is <b>Zhen (/zen/)</b> and I live in San Francisco, California.  Before I came to San Francisco, I lived in a few different places: China for 12 years, Kamehameha Street in Honolulu, Hawaii for 4 months, Los Angeles for 6 years, and San Diego for 6 years . Because of living in China and US, I became fluent in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and one of the many Chinese dialects.",		
		"content2":"In June 2014, I graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Cognitive Science specializing in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). To complete my specialization in HCI, I opted to take computer science courses to improve my programming skills and expand my understanding of computer engineering.  Therefore, one of my strengths as a designer is the ability to handle both the graphical and technical aspects of a project to make everything easily accessible and user-friendly. Additionally, being a detail-oriented person, I strive to make all my technical and graphic designs perfect, including redrawing images and/or doing whatever it takes to make every pixel perfect.",
		"content3":"Some random fun facts about me:<ul><li>I am a huge dog-lover.  I rescued two amazing dogs from the animal shelter, a Maltese Mix named Pookie and a SharPei mix named Penelope. (If you want to see photos of my adorable dogs, follow me on Instagram!)</li><li>I am an awesome Ping-Pong player.  And Iâ€™m also pretty good at tennis.</li><li> I wanted to be a firefighter, so I have a certificate in Fire Protection Technology and was a Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technician.</li></ul>",
